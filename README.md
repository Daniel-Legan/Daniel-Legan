### Howdy! 👋

I recently relocated from Minneapolis, MN to Vienna, VA. As a software developer, I am also an avid biker, hiker, gamer, and problem solver. I enjoy building apps that are easy to follow and modify.

- 🔭 Open for work! [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-legan-365120241/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: TypeScript, AWS, and Advanced React
- 🚧 Latest project: Wildlife Spotter; a Google Maps wildlife marker application
- 🧐 Fun fact: Most herbivores are opportunistic carnivores. I watched a deer eat a dead snake on TikTok the other day. Crazy!
